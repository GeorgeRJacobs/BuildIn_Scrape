### Game Plan
1. Start with this address: https://www.builtinchicago.org/companies?status=all
    + First, I noticed they have a pagination bar at the bottom. Hopefully, that means we can 
      page thru the datasource quite easily.  Just append the right number to the web page url and 
      away we go. 
    + Second, we will need to gather the links from the search results, store them, them step into them 
      to grab the data we need. 
    + Third, we may need to step into those websites to gather the right contact information.
